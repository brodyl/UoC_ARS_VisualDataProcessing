# Visual Data Processing

## University of Calgary AI Research School (March 2023)

This repo covers the fundamentals of visual data processing and then goes over the basics of using three image processing libraries including Pillow, Skimage, and OpenCV to pre-process images and videos.

If you open this repo in Colab, you see two notebooks:

- *Tutorial.ipynb*: This is the raw notebook with three practical challenges.
- *Tutorial_with_code.ipynb*: This version has all the cells executed with the challenges solved with some code examples.

Have fun coding!
